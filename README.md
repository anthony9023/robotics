  * [RUBIX - VEX IQ Rubik's Cube Solver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGxpXlIaIaA)
  * [RUBIX 2.0 - VEX IQ Rubik's Cube Solver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6gSuM-JHgo)
    * Pros:
      * Requires less motor (More stable)
      * Requires fewer parts
      * Simpler (More reliable)
    * Cons:
      * Slow (more moves)
      * Logic is quite Complex(with only one rotating face, keeping track of where each face becomes difficult)
